#### Project was made based on my classroom exercices

<h1 style"align-text=center;"> Project: Data Structure Tree (Binary tree) on Java </h1>
 A project about Data Structure using tree model
 
## What I use?

Java
    

## Content and How it Work's:

Content:
  <ul>
    <li>Here we have class Node, Tree and Main:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Tree class will be contain root of the binary tree</li>
        <li>Node class will be use to create and link the Node of tree</li>
        <li>Main class will be use to execute we project</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

How work's:
   <ul>
    <li>First we need to insert the nodes in tree, by default the first will be the root, and next will be store using a rule, if the number of Node is minor than root, will be store in left Node, else if bigger than root it will be store on right Node</li>
    <li>The rule about inserting Nodes is used in sequence insertions, bigger on right Node and minor on left Node</li>
    <li>Next we have some methods to print the Tree data, see a degree of a Node or find a Node on Tree</li>
  </ul>
